        <p>The Milkey Way Galaxy is our own galaxy. It is 100,000 light years across. to put that into perspective, the last time we were on the other side of it, the dinosaurs had recently died. Our galaxy is currently on a several billion year crash course with another galaxy nearly twice the size as our own.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Ton 618 is the former largest known black hole. Black holes are extreamly massive entities that are so powerful that even light cannot escape them. This one in particular completely dwarves our solar system. It even broke a record when it was first discovered, having a mass of 66 billion solar masses, that means the mass of our sun, which shattered the previous theoretical limit of 50 billion. The image used here is an illustration, as it is very difficult to photograph something that is practically invisible to our eyes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Pillars of Creation picture is possibly on of the most famous. It consists of solar dust and gas and is located in the Eagle Nebula. They span around 4-5 light years across.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Cat's Eye Nebula is a nebula that happens to look like a cat's eye, hense the name. Like with most images taken of space, you can't actually see many parts of the nebula, and the parts you do see look a lot less cool. This, and many others, is enhanced using illustrations of the different wavelengths of light, ones that we cant see.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Pale Blue Dot photograph is one of the most impactful ever taken. It was taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft soon before its camera was shut off to save power. It is a picture of Earth. The entire planet we've ever seen and lived on, every conflict we've ever had, every war fought, ever child ever to be born, all of that tiny dot. This is how it was described by many, and why it is, and will forever remain, one of the most impactful pictures ever taken.</p>
        <br>
        <p>J1407b may be a mouthful, but it has a more famous name of "Super Saturn". It got this name from its massive rings that completely over shadow Saturn's own rings in terms of size. If it took the place of Saturn, it would be larger that the moon in the night, and day, sky.</p>
